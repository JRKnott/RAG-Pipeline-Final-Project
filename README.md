## Domain Overview & Problem Statement.
The domain I wanted to focus on in this project is financial advice and how a RAG based agent can help investors by generating advise using a pre-selected set of data. I think this is interesting because currently AI is becoming used more by small-scale investors. As a Finance major, I want to learn a little bit more about Machine Learning applications and how they can be applied to investment services, and this project was a great opportunity for me to do so. 

## A Brief Overview of my Project Pipeline

These two images display what my project pipeline looks like. The first starts with my data sources, and then moves towards my final output. The second looks at the User Input and the process of getting the output from the LLM Model (ChatGPT). This processed utilized preprocessing and generating chunks utilizing class code through google Colab, aswell as using CrewAI for creating my Agent, and DuckDB for creating my database.
